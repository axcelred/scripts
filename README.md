# Scripts
This is my collection of scripts that I have found useful over the years. 

Feel free to use these in your own environment. I've tried to sanitise the scripts and verify they're working as best as I can, but I take no responsibility if you run these scripts without proper testing first.

Feedback is welcomed.
